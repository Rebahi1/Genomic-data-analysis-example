Task 1: Introduction and Objective
Background:
Transposable elements (L1) and retroviruses (HIV, MLV) integrate into host genomes in potentially non-random patterns. Understanding their integration preferences provides insights into silencing mechanisms and mutagenic effects.

Research Question:
Do L1 retrotransposons, HIV lentivirus, and MLV retrovirus exhibit preferential integration into specific functional chromatin regions?

Approach:

Genomic intersection analysis of insertion sites with ChromHMM states
Statistical enrichment testing using hypergeometric distribution
Publication-quality visualization of integration preferences
